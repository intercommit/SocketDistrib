SocketDistrib
=============

The basis for a Java multi-threaded socket network server. 
Not just an example, but actually used in our 24x7 production systems.
It is small (5 average sized classes) and fast (using Java concurrent) 
and designed with previous experiences with network server implementations in mind.

A Maven project and documentation will be added in the next few weeks
(first time using git and GitHub, takes a while to get used to).
